# Ray-Tracing
Ray tracing creates images by tracking the journey of light rays and how they interact with virtual objects to produce realistic visuals.
The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism, usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost.
This was implemented in python using the "numpy" and "matplotlib.pyplot" libraries.
